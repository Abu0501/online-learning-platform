# Online Learning Platform - Project Documentation

## Project Overview

The **Online Learning Platform** project is a MERN stack application allowing educators to create and manage courses, while students can browse, enroll, and complete courses. The platform provides role-based features for students, educators, and admins, creating a streamlined learning experience. This application has three core components: frontend (React user interface), backend (API and data handling), and an admin panel (for course and user management).

## Key Functionalities

### Student Features:

- **Registration & Login**: Register or log in to access the platform.
- **Course Browsing**: View and filter courses by category or name.
- **Enrollment & Learning**: Enroll in individual courses, continue where you left off, and track course progress.
- **Certification**: Download a completion certificate after course completion.

### Educator Features:

- **Course Management**: Add, update, and delete courses. Each course can have multiple sections with titles and content.
- **Student Monitoring**: View enrolled students and manage course content.
- **Conditions for Course Deletion**: Courses with no enrolled students can be deleted automatically.

### Admin Features:

- **User Management**: Admins can monitor all users, including students and educators.
- **Course Oversight**: Admins have access to manage all courses and user activities.

## Dependencies and Installation

### Frontend (React)

The frontend is built with React, using Axios for API calls and Context API for state management.

- **Installation**:
    
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    npm start
    
    ```
    
- **Key Libraries**:
    - **axios**: For making API requests to the backend.
    - **react-router-dom**: For navigation between pages.
    - **context-api**: Manages user and course data states.
- **Example Imports**:
    
    ```jsx
    
    import React from 'react';
    import axios from 'axios';
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
    
    ```
    

### Backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB)

The backend API is built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB for data storage and handling user authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- **Installation**:
    
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    npm run dev
    
    ```
    
- **Key Libraries**:
    - **express**: API framework for handling routes and requests.
    - **mongoose**: For MongoDB database interactions.
    - **bcrypt**: For password encryption.
    - **jsonwebtoken**: For secure user authentication.
    - **dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
- **Example Imports**:
    
    ```jsx
    
    const express = require('express');
    const mongoose = require('mongoose');
    const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
    
    ```
    

### Admin Panel (React)

The admin panel is also built in React, allowing for management of users, courses, and system activities.

- **Installation**:
    
    ```bash
    
    cd admin
    npm install
    npm start
    
    ```
    
- **Key Libraries**:
    - **axios**: For API communication with the backend.
    - **react-table**: For displaying course and user data in tables.
    - **redux**: For state management across the admin interface.
- **Example Imports**:
    
    ```jsx
    
    import React from 'react';
    import { useDispatch, useSelector } from 'react-redux';
    import axios from 'axios';
    
    ```

## Database

MongoDB is used to store data related to users, courses, and enrollments. The database connection details are stored in environment variables within a `.env` file in the backend.

Example `.env` file:

```

MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster.mongodb.net/online-learning
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

```

---

## Project Setup

### Environment Setup:

1. Ensure MongoDB, Node.js, and npm are installed.
2. Set up the `.env` file for backend configurations, including `MONGO_URI` and `JWT_SECRET`.

### Running the Project:

1. **Start the Backend Server**:
    
    ```bash
    
    cd backend
    npm run dev
    
    ```
    
2. **Run Frontend and Admin Panel**: Open separate terminal windows, navigate to `frontend` and `admin` directories, and start each with `npm start`.

## API Endpoints (Backend)

### User Authentication

- **POST /api/users/register**: Register a new user.
- **POST /api/users/login**: Login an existing user.

### Courses

- **GET /api/courses**: Fetch all courses.
- **POST /api/courses**: Add a new course (educator or admin only).
- **DELETE /api/courses/**: Delete a course based on criteria.

### Enrollments

- **POST /api/enroll**: Enroll a user in a course.
- **GET /api/enrollments/**: Fetch all enrollments for a specific user.

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-Time Notifications**: Add notifications for new courses or updates.
- **Recommendation System**: Suggest courses based on user preferences.
- **Enhanced Analytics**: Include insights on popular courses and user engagement.

## Conclusion

The **Online Learning Platform** project provides a comprehensive solution for online learning, utilizing the MERN stack to offer an interactive, user-focused experience. This project integrates secure authentication, robust course management, and easy-to-navigate interfaces, setting the foundation for scalable and user-friendly learning experiences.
